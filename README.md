This is a project in C# that my friend and I made on our second year of college. It's a simple application for managing buses line, where the manager can add/deleted/change 
another station for line route and another bus line , and the users can see all the detials about the line bus and when the bus will be arrived in real time.

It has nice functionalities, such as searching units according to specific parameters, admin function for monitoring all the units, and changing or adding the routes.
